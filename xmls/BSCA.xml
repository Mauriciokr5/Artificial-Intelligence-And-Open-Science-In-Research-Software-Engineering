<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p><s>Today, the complete DNA sequences of many organisms are already known, and the completion of human genome project is making steady progress.</s><s>The information of DNA sequences, RNA sequences, and amino-acid sequences of proteins are stored in molecular biology databases.</s><s>It is well known that the sizes of these databases are increasing nowadays very fast.</s><s>Therefore it is needed to store and communicate data efficiently.</s><s>Furthermore, there are other reasons to study compression of biological sequences.</s></p><p><s>Understanding the Properties of DNA Sequences Using Compression Algorithms Since DNA sequences contain four symbols 'a,' 't,' 'g, <ref type="bibr">'</ref> and 'c,' if these were totally random, the most efficient way to represent them would be using two bits for each symbol.</s><s>However, only a small fraction of DNA sequences result in a viable organism, therefore the sequences which appear in a living organism are expected to be nonrandom and have some constraints.</s></p><p><s>In other words, they should be compressible.</s><s>The studies in compression algorithms for DNA sequences answer the basic et al.</s></p><p><s>question about the compressibility of DNA sequences, and from a viewpoint of information science, we can use compression techniques to capture the properties of DNA sequences.</s><s>It is known that DNA sequences have two characteristic structures.</s><s>One is reverse complements, and the other is approximate repeats.</s><s>The reverse complement of a sequence is a reverse sequence whose each symbol is replaced with its complement one.</s><s>The approximate repeats are repeats that contains errors.</s><s>There have been developed several special-purpose compression algorithms for DNA sequences (Grumbach and Tahi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Chen, Kwong and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Lanctot, Li and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>).</s><s>These algorithms use the structures and can achieve high compression ratio.</s></p><p><s>There is a difference between the compression ratio of coding and non-coding regions of DNA sequence, and this is supported by a biological hypothesis (Lanctot, Li and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) .</s><s>Not all of the DNA sequence specify a protein.</s><s>In higher eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) much of the sequence is cut out before the cell translates it into protein.</s><s>Random mutations in a DNA sequence are thought to be more deleterious if they take place in a coding regions rather than in a non-coding regions.</s><s>Therefore the two regions should have different information theoretic entropy.</s></p><p><s>With conditional compression ratio, we can evaluate the "distance" between pairs of DNA sequences (Chen, Kwong and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) .</s><s>DNA sequences that are "close" to each other are required to be "close" to each other on the evolutionary tree, thus the "distance" on the evolutionary tree can be measured by compression algorithms.</s><s>Therefore we can guess whether organisms are "close" on the evolutionary tree using compression algorithms.</s><s>The minimum alignment score also can be used to estimate the distance between a pair of sequences, however it is good only to measure two genes that are closely related.</s><s>It can hardly handle simple changes like reversal, translocation, and shuffling.</s><s>Using conditional compression ratio is more robust than using the minimum alignment score.</s><s>Note that we can choose a compression algorithm for defining similarities of sequences so that the compression ratio and the score of the alignment have one-to-one correspondence.</s><s>Thus compression of DNA sequence is important not only for improvement of efficiency of storage or communication but also for understanding the properties of DNA sequences.</s></p><p><s>Using DNA Sequences as a Challenging Subject for Compression Algorithms DNA sequences only contain four symbols, therefore two bits per symbol is enough to represent these sequences even if they are totally random.</s><s>However if one applies the standard text compression software such as compress or gzip, they cannot compress DNA sequences but only expand the file with more than two bits per symbol.</s><s>Thus DNA sequences are important as a new challenge for study of compression algorithms.</s><s>There are some reasons pointed out.</s><s>These software are designed mainly for English text compression, while the regularities in DNA sequences are much subtler (Chen, Kwong and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</s><s>Generally the windows of the methods based on dictionary have a fixed width of small size.</s><s>The use of small windows is efficient on text whose redundancy is local.</s><s>However, in the case of DNA sequence, redundancies may occur at very long distances and factors can be very long (Grumbach and Tahi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) .</s></p><p><s>Huffman's code also fails badly on DNA sequences both in the static and adaptive model, because there are only four kind symbols in DNA sequences and the probabilities of occurrence of the symbols are not very different.</s></p><p><s>Concerning compression ratio, PPM (Cleary and Witten <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) is one of the best compression algorithms in practice.</s><s>However it cannot compress DNA sequences less than two bits per symbol either.</s></p><p><s>It is true that the compression of DNA sequence is a difficult task for general compression algorithms, but at the same time, from the viewpoint of compression theory it is an interesting subject for understanding the properties of various compression algorithms.</s></p><p><s>Contributions of this paper Reverse complements and approximate repeats are known as characteristic structures of DNA sequences.</s><s>We introduce a new DNA-oriented compression algorithm that uses context tree weighting and takes account of the characteristic structures of DNA sequences.</s><s>Biological Sequence Compression Algorithms</s></p><p><s>The new algorithm has a function for searching reverse complements or approximate repeats using hash table and dynamic programming, and if there is one, the algorithm represents it by its length and distance.</s><s>Our new algorithm can achieve a little higher compression ratio than that of existing special purpose compression algorithms for DNA sequences.</s></p><p><s>It is known that compression of proteins is a difficult task (Nevill-Manning and Witten <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>) .</s><s>The standard compression algorithms such as gzip or compress cannot compress proteins but only expand them in size.</s><s>There is a special purpose compression algorithm for proteins that takes account of the underlying biochemical principles and it can compress proteins, although the compression ratio is not very high.</s><s>Therefore proteins are said to be incompressible.</s><s>We show that many general compression algorithms can really compress proteins.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Compression Algorithms</head><p><s>We briefly explain two compression algorithms used in our algorithm.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">PPM</head><p><s>PPM (Cleary and Witten <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) is a kind of statistical compression algorithms and has a high compression ratio.</s><s>PPM predicts the probability of next symbol using preceding several symbols called context, and then compresses a sequence of symbols one by one with this probability.</s><s>The maximum value of length d of the context is called order of PPM.</s><s>This value is one of parameters of PPM.</s></p><p><s>Calculate Probability using Context For each substring of input data whose length is less than or equal to order, PPM stores the frequency of the each symbol that appears after the context.</s><s>With this values, PPM estimates the probability of the next symbol.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Value of order</head><p><s>If the value of order becomes bigger, the precision of the prediction is improved.</s></p><p><s>However on the other hand, the flexibility of the prediction is lost and the frequency of esc increases.</s></p><p><s>The increase of the frequency of esc has a bad influence on the compression ratio, therefore there is an optimal value of order.</s></p><p><s>For each sequence, the optimal value of order exists.</s></p><p><s>It is well known that the optimal value of order is five for many English texts.</s></p><p><s>For DNA sequences, in many cases the optimal value of order is less than five.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Context Tree Weighting</head><p><s>Context Tree Weighting (CTW) is a universal compression algorithm for FSMX sources proposed by Willems et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>.</s><s>and expected to have good compression ratio with an unknown model and unknown parameters.</s><s>FSMX sources are related to Tree sources with the property that the next symbol probabilities depend on preceding several symbols.</s><s>The PPM algorithm uses only one model, but the CTW guesses the probabilities by adding up all possible models using weighting.</s><s>et al.</s></p><p><s>Context Tree The contexts are represented in a tree form and called a context tree.</s><s>Each node of the tree represents a context.</s><s>All the tree have to satisfy is the restrictions of FSMX sources, for convenience of explanation we assume that the maximum depth of the context tree is D. At each node one store the frequency of the each symbol that appears after the context.</s><s>Each value of the frequencies of a parent node is the summation of the values of its children.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probabilities at Each Context</head><p><s>For each context, the probability of the next symbol is estimated with the frequencies of symbols stored in the corresponding node of the context tree.</s><s>For the probability of a symbol c at a context s we write Pse (c).</s><s>This value is calculated by the concept of the PPM algorithm.</s><s>In the original algorithm of Willems et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> the Krichevski-Trofimov (KT) probability estimator is used.</s><s>In the PPM algorithm, a special escape symbol esc is used.</s><s>If a novel symbol c appears in a context sd which has depth of d, esc is encoded in context sd and then c is encoded in a context sd-1 which has depth of d-1.</s><s>To use the idea of esc in the CTW program, the estimate for the probability of the symbol c is the probability of esc in the context sd times the probability of c in the shorter context sd-1 .</s><s>In the null context A, probabilities of symbols they have not appeared are all equal and they divide the escape probability equally among themselves.</s><s>We denote by A the set of all alphabets.</s><s>The probability Pe t (c) is calculated as follows:  3 DNA-Oriented Compression Algorithms</s></p><p><s>It is known that DNA sequences have characteristic structures that cannot be observed in other kinds of data such as English text.</s><s>There are several special purpose compression and entropy estimating algorithms for DNA sequence that use these structures are studied and the compression ratio of these algorithms are better than two bits per symbol (Grumbach and Tahi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Chen, Kwong and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Lanctot, Li and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approximate Repeats</head><p><s>DNA sequences, especially ones of higher eukaryotes , have many repeats.</s><s>It has been conjectured that this is because genes duplicate themselves sometimes for evolutionary or simply for "selfish" purposes.</s><s>Containing many repeats is favorable for compression algorithms , however such regularities are often blurred by random mutations.</s><s>Therefore it is important to adapt to repeats that contain errors.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Judgment of Using Edit Operations</head><p><s>Our new function searches approximate repeats or approximate reverse complements using dynamic programming.</s><s>With more edit operations the length can be enlarged, however we must determine where to stop dynamic programming to maximize the profit and improve the compression ratio.</s><s>The algorithm estimates the number of bits needed to encode the repeat by CTW using the compression ratio of the sequence already encoded, and find the combination of edit operations that provides the biggest difference.</s><s>When the length is short, the distance is long or many edit operations is needed, the structure cannot provide profit and then the algorithm does not use it.</s></p></div>
